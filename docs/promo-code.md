## Durations
There are two types of duration
- once 
- forever
#### Once
Duration once means that the code can only be used one time in total - like it’s only valid one time and then it doesn’t work anymore. 
#### Forever
Duration forever means that the code can be used only 1 time per customer but the code never expires - so multiple customers can use the code but only 1 time
